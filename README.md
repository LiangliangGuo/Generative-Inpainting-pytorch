# Generative-Inpainting-pytorch
This is a pytorch version of the paper 'Generative Image Inpainting with Contextual Attention' (by Jiahui Yu et al. / 2018 CVPR)

# P.S
I made this network for catching up SOTA technique of the Image Inpainting area.
Though it trains without any bug, generated images are mostly blurry.
I will update code soon, if possible.

**If you have any interest in my code, I strongly suggest that use this as a baseline.**
But you need to check contextual module performance or critics convergence.
